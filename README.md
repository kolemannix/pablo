pablo
=====

Pablo is my second chess engine. Unlike my first engine Tyrannus, Pablo does not have a GUI and is just backend chess code. I plan to implement some sort of protocol (UCI or XBoard) if I continue work on Pablo. The Tyrannus project can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tyrannus/?source=directory

Currently, Pablo posseses a basic command line interface which can be invoked by running "java -jar pablo-($YOUR_VERSION).jar"
