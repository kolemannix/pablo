pablo
=====

Pablo is my second attempt at writing a chess engine in Java. Unlike my first attempt, Tyrannus, Pablo is not affiliated with any GUI and is just pure chess code. I plan to implement some sort of protocol (UCI or XBoard) if I continue work on Pablo.

Currently, Pablo posseses a basic command line interface which can be invoked by running "java -jar pablo-($YOUR_VERSION).jar"
